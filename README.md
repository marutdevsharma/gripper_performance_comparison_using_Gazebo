# gripper_performance_comparison_using_Gazebo
this paper intends to provide readers with a planning model to help them determine which gripper to choose and the necessary parameters for designing and developing a gripper for successful pick and place operation. In addition, by following the guidelines, more consistent research might be conducted using human hand grasping taxonomies and reported for the betterment of object pick and place by robot arm.
The contribution of the research is to help the researchers to choose between parallel and 3 finger gripper based upon their specific pick and place requirements based upon perfor-mance comparison between them on various parameters such as grasping force, slipping metric, cost and human hand grasping taxonomies
